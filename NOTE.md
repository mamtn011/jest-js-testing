# Javascript Testing

### Classification

**There are three types of testing**

1. **Unit Test:** Test a single function/action
2. **Integration Test:** Test a function with dependencies - a function that calls another function
3. **End-to-End:** Complete test - automate browser events.

### How to test

- To test we need to install a test runner like `Mocha` (run the test and give result) and an assertion library lick `Chai` (set testing conditions, matches, & logics) and a headless browser for e2e test like `Puppeteer`.

- There are some tool like `Jest` which provide test runner and assertion library together. In this project we will use `Jest`.

### Use of Jest

- Install jest

- Create `__tests__` folder in the root of the project.

- Create file `fileName.test.js`.

- Now write test script and run.
